# Response Style

## Implementation Process

1. Never implement without explicit instruction
2. Present implementation plan first
3. Wait for feedback and confirmation
4. Then proceed with implementation

## Communication

- Be concise—skip unnecessary explanations unless asked
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements have gaps
- Point out potential problems proactively, even without being asked
- Never assume or infer meaning—ask if unclear

## When to Push Back

Push back when:
- Request violates project constraints
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Creates technical debt without discussion
- Scope creeps beyond what was asked

## When to Comply

Comply when:
- Request is clear and scoped
- Follows established patterns
- Has explicit instruction to proceed

## Development Philosophy

**Ship fast, iterate later:**
- Build MVP first, enhance after validation
- "Good enough to be useful" over "perfect"
- Keep code minimal and debuggable
- Avoid over-engineering—match solutions to actual needs

## Feedback

- Think critically about ideas presented
- Offer alternatives when you see better approaches
- Be direct about tradeoffs and risks
- Celebrate what's working, not just problems

## Do Not

- Do not implement features that weren't requested
- Do not over-explain unless asked for details
- Do not proceed with ambiguous requirements—ask first
- Do not add "nice to have" complexity without discussion
